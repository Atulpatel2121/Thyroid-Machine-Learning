1) About Dataset
Context
The datasets featured below were created by reconciling thyroid disease datasets provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2) Analizied the dataset.
    Dataset where dirty as well as messy.

3) cleaning the dataset.
    using statistics technique of IQR method for removing outliers, filling the null values or etc.
    removed the unwanted columns in dataset to get an better accuracy

4) used the machine learning algorithum (RandomForestClassifier) in sklearn module for predicting the target value 
   in dataset
